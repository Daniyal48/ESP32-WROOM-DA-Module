# ESP-Honeypot
This honeypot mimics a simple IoT device with multiple services running and also command interface via serial communication. This Honeypot is using Multi-threading and Mutex-Locks concpets. This will help newbies to understand the concpet of Mutex-Locks and Multi-Tasking. Further features will be added wth time such as OTA updates etc. This Honeypot is using a server based logging system the goal is to use less resources as much as possible. This also gives us an advantage to manage the logs on the server more eficiently as we are too limited with the processing and memory on the ESP board itself.
